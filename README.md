**Description:**  
Lottery Choco Pie is an interactive lottery game designed to attract Gen Z to the exciting world of lotteries. With colorful graphics and engaging gameplay, this project aims to make the lottery experience fun and appealing. It was awarded 2nd prize at the Hacker413 Hackathon at UMass Amherst, presented by the Mass Lottery.

## Inspiration

Our team wanted to create a game that brings the excitement of lottery-style gaming to a format that's both accessible and enjoyable for Gen Z gamers. We took inspiration from classic games like Keno and modern hits like Candy Crush, aiming to design an experience that's simple yet engaging, with a sweet twist.

## What it does

"Lottery Choco Pie" is a colorful, Keno-inspired casual game that challenges players to win with a mix of strategy and luck. It features a variety of delightful desserts and snacks as game elements, with eye-catching animations and a "You Win!" moment that's as satisfying as biting into a choco pie.

## Features

- **Colorful Gameplay:** Engaging visuals with vibrant colors and fun shapes.
- **User Interaction:** Players can select shapes and colors to try and win.
- **Grid-Based Game:** A 5x5 grid where users aim to match their selections to win.
- **Exciting Feedback:** Immediate feedback on win/lose conditions.
